## Installation

```bash
composer require upmind/provision-provider-shared-hosting
```

## Usage

This library makes use of [upmind/provision-provider-base](https://packagist.org/packages/upmind/provision-provider-base) primitives which we suggest you familiarize yourself with by reading the usage section in the README.

### Quick-start

See the below example to create a cPanel account:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;
use Upmind\ProvisionBase\ProviderFactory;

$configuration = [
    'hostname' => 'whm.example.com',
    'port' => 2087,
    'whm_username' => 'root',
    'api_key' => '{secret key}',
];

$factory = App::make(ProviderFactory::class);
$provider = $factory->create('shared-hosting', 'cpanel', $configuration);

$createParameters = [
    'email' => 'harry@upmind.com',
    'domain' => 'example.com',
    'package_name' => 'starter_package',
];
$function = $provider->makeJob('create', $createParameters);

$createResult = $function->execute();

if ($createResult->isError()) {
    throw new RuntimeException($createResult->getMessage(), 0, $createResult->getException());
}

/** @var \Upmind\ProvisionProviders\SharedHosting\Data\AccountInfo */
$accountInfo = $createResult->getData();

// $accountInfo->username; // username/identifier of the created hosting account
// ...
```
